# Project-Chandan
-- Task1 --
I have designed and developed an Academic Management System using SQL. The projects involves three tables 
1.StudentInfo 
2. CoursesInfo 
3.EnrollmentInfo. 
The Aim is to create a system that allows for managing student information and course enrollment.

-- Task2 --
I have designed and implemented a student database management system using PostgreSQL that allows storing and retrieving student information efficiently.
The project has a table with student details like Id, name, department, phone number etc.
I have performed data entry, Student Information Retrieval, other queries like extracting male students, students with GPA<5, Update queries and Grouping calculations.

I have attached both the code and screenshto in the word doc

-- Task3 -- 
I have developed the application that allows users to create and manage events, track attendees, and handle event registrations efficiently.
Under section 5 I have developed queries to retrieve event information, generate attendee lists, and calculate event attendance statistics.
Few of the queries are:
 - Generate a List of Attendees for a Specific Event
 - Calculate the Total Number of Attendees for Each Event
 - Calculate the Total Registration Amount Collected for Each Event
 - Calculate the Maximum and Minimum Registration Amount Collected for Each Event
 - List Events and Their Corresponding Attendee Count Grouped by Event Location
 - Calculate the Total Number of Events an Attendee Has Registered For

-- Task3 -- 
I have developed the queries to retrieve information from the OLAP operations performed and to gain a deeper understanding of the sales data through different dimensions, aggregations, and filters. I have used PostgreSQL to perform the queries.
